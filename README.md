# ResilienceAI: Supply Chain Risk Intelligence

ResilienceAI is a sophisticated risk management platform designed to provide real-time visibility and predictive simulation for global supply chain disruptions. Built for the modern enterprise, it combines multi-agent AI systems with dynamic data visualization to turn complex global signals into actionable intelligence.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌍 Global Risk Dashboard
- **Real-time Threat Clusters**: Interactive world map visualizing active risk hotspots using AI-driven clustering.
- **Top Metrics**: Instant overview of global risk levels, active alerts, and affected supply routes.

### 🌊 Dynamic Cascade Simulator
- **Risk Propagation Modeling**: Simulate how a single event (e.g., a border closure or a currency crash) cascades through secondary and tertiary dependencies.
- **Specialized Templates**: Custom graph topologies for distinct disaster types:
  - **Conflict**: Linear escalation and regional instability.
  - **Economy**: Hub-and-spoke financial contagion (Bank runs, investment flight).
  - **Weather**: Cascading infrastructure damage and humanitarian crises.
- **Live Lookups**: Generate simulation scenarios on-the-fly for any country in the world.

### 🏛️ Country Deep Dive
- **360° Risk Profile**: Radar charts and historical timelines across Conflict, Economy, Weather, and Food security.
- **Live AI Analysis**: Real-time assessments generated by specialized agents, providing context-aware risk narratives for specific regions.
- **Data Integrations**: Leverages datasets from ERA5 (Climate), EM-DAT (Disasters), and ACLED (Conflict).

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Network
- **Supervisor Routing**: A central brain that triages user queries to specialized agents (Weather, News, Finance).
- **Automated Formatter**: Post-processing agent that ensures every response is structured as clean, readable Markdown.
- **Execution Trace**: Fully transparent logs showing exactly how the agents collaborated to find your answer.
